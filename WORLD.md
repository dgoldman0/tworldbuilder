# The WORLD Token

The first step in creating this game is to create the WORLD token. I want this token to be a utility token rather than a security token. It's primary function is going to be interacting with the market. Since there won't be any ICO, I will have to make sure that I can distribute these tokens in other ways, even before the ability to receive tokens as part of the building purchase operation goes live. Airdrops are of course one option. Referral bonuses will be another option. A third option is to provide some of the tokens to publish0x for tipping. However, they only use ERC-20 tokens at the moment, which means that I'll either have to wait until publish0x hopefully adds TRC-10/20 tokens or use Ethereum instead of Tron.

# Inflation

Instead of a fixed rate of inflation, I think it might make more sense for the inflation rate to be a function of a base inflation rate and the rate of new town construction. The more towns, the faster tokens should be added. Tokens will be distributed through virtual mining, thus making it a fourth way in which tokens will be distributed to the population.

## Simulated Mining

In order to mine, people will have to pay for mining tools and supplies. They'll buy in game items that will determine how well they can mine. In a way, this system is a proof of stake system, as people are paying for the ability to get new tokens, but it's with added game play.

In the real world, as people mine for resources, they become more scarce. To simulate this effect, as tokens are generated from towns, the rate of increase will decline. Essentially, the potential minable resources in the town will decrease.

Over time, this method of obtaining WORLD will become the primary method as the rate of distribution for WORLD from purchasing new buildings decreases.
