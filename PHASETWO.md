This file discusses some of the ideas for a potential phase II of this game.

# Main Thoughts
One of the main ideas behind phase two is to make this game more physical in the sense that a virtual space should be represented. A town should consist of a certain number of empty blocks that can be filled by buildings. Of course different buildings will have different block sizes. A small building might take up one block, while a resort might take up a 16 x 16 grid.

The player could be the investigator, but it would be wonderful to be able to integrate Blockchain Cuties into this game. Cuties would have stats that are important to this game play. For instance, strength will be needed in order to carry items of different sizes. Perception will be important to find items. Speed will help determine how much ground can be covered. And stamina would be important to see how long an investigator can keep up their search.
