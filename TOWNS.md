Why stop with buildings? A building has to go somewhere after all. In this game, there are towns. Buildings must be constructed in a given town. You can either build in an existing town or create your own town.

Items can be found throughout your town, but you'll have to look for them. Bigger townsâ€”ones with more buildings-have more items to find, but they may also be more crowded. The drop rate is a function of the number of buildings, so you'll either need more buildings or fewer players looking, in order to maximize your chances of finding useful items.

But why start a town? They're very expensive to start. The answer is simple: taxes. The town's owner can set the tax rate for the town, when they create it. Once created, it cannot be changed (with perhaps a few exceptions) in order to prevent people from drawing in a lot of people with low taxes only to raise them afterwards. The tax rate can range for 0% all the way up to 50%. 

What if I build in the wrong town? Well, you can't move your building around, but you can sell it in the marketplace. While the game could include a "move building" mechanic, it would reduce the pseudo-realistic aspect of the game.
