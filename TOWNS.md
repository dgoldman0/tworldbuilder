Why stop with buildings? A building has to go somewhere after all. In this game, there are towns. Buildings must be constructed in a given town. You can either build in an existing town or create your own town.

Items can be found throughout your town, but you'll have to look for them. Bigger townsâ€”ones with more buildings-have more items to find, but they may also be more crowded. The drop rate is a function of the number of buildings, so you'll either need more buildings or fewer players looking, in order to maximize your chances of finding useful items.

But why start a town? They're very expensive to start. The answer is simple: taxes. The town's owner can set the tax rate for the town, when they create it. Once created, it cannot be changed (with perhaps a few exceptions) in order to prevent people from drawing in a lot of people with low taxes only to raise them afterwards. The tax rate can range for 0% all the way up to 50%. As for price, it will cost roughly 250,000 TRX to create a new town. It is the single most expensive purchase in the game, but it can potentially be a massive cash pool. Furthermore, having a town will come with other advantages, including special items that only town owners can get.

What if I build in the wrong town? Well, you can't move your building around, but you can sell it in the marketplace. While the game could include a "move building" mechanic, it would reduce the pseudo-realistic aspect of the game.

Politics is important, no matter what you're doing. Another major advantage of having a town is that you can be involved in the governance of The World. One issue with dapps is that blockchain persistence makes upgrades and changes to the code very difficult. There should be a way to do it. The easiest way is just to create a wrapper contract that allows the owner to change over to a new version. But this system results in less confidence. The whole point of a dapp is that it's trustless.

A compromise can be made by allowing super-users to run the upgrade. A lot of blockchain systems use this approach. Indeed, Tron is in many ways governed by a number of super users. In this world, the super users are the town owners. Any change in contract must be approved by a super majority of the town owners, and also the base contract owner.
