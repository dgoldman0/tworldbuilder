# Introduction
Ever since the concept of dapps emerged, people have tried making various games utilizing blockchain technology. Unfortunately, many of these "games" were little more than gambling sites and ponzi schemes. A common example is the simple "economic game" where people buy virtual property which pays dividends out of the fund. When the fund is empty, the "game" stops. Many examples of this game are basically copied with little to no changes. However, with a little bit of economic theory and some work, even these simple "games" can be converted into a real entertaining game that can last for a long time, if not indefinitely.

# Zero-Sum, Negative-Sum, and Positive-Sum Games
In the world of economic theory, there's a concept called a zero-sum game. A zero-sum game is any economic game in which someone benefitting results in another person losing the same amount. However, there are worse games than zero-sum games. Negative-sum games ensure even more losers. Gambling is really a negative-sum game, because you're always expected to get back less than you put in, and there's loss from profits being taken. In order to keep a negative-sum game running, more and more players need to add more and more resources. When people stop adding more money, the game quickly comes to an end.

In many ways, the universe is a zero-sum game. There's a fixed amount of energy, and as we utilize it, there's less and less available energy to use. However, as depressing as this idea sounds, it's not a big deal. In reality, we have plenty of available energy. The sun bathes us with energy which is generated from nuclear fusion. Eventually this energy trickles into our economies, our stock markets, and so on. That's why economic systems on Earth are positive-sum games: games which people, on average, get out more than they put in.

# Keeping the Economic System "Open"
In order for this "economic game" to be anything close to a positive-sum game, we need something like the sun. We need something that provides us with new available resources. Luckily, any online game that brings in daily views can be useful in other ways. Here are a few ways in which a website can be monetized. Regardless of the fact that this project is a blockchain based economic game, the general rules of monetizing webpages are the same.

- Advertisements are not bad, although many of the websites on cryptoassets load the page with spam.
- Affiliate links are a great way to generate revenue from webpages.
- If you have a product that you want to sell, you can sell it on the site.

# Useless Tokens
Since these games are dapps, they generally function by providing their own token. The tokens are generally either ERC-20 or TRC-10 tokens, depending on the blockchain being used. But there's nothing that you can do with the tokens, other than buying them and selling them on an exchange, if someone is actually willing to buy an essentially useless token. While [many currencies are fiat, meaning that they have no value beyond the value that they obtain as a result of their being a currency](https://medium.com/politicoid/money-and-wealth-a2d153094df3?source=friends_link&sk=fe6adb1fd4ef05a09a48a7ba810651ef), with a little bit of thought, it's possible to create some use for the tokens.

## Marketplace
One key aspect that most of these "games" lack is a way out. Once you buy a building, you're stuck. This idea of having no way to get out of the game is obviously very troubling and probably turns a lot of potential users off. A marketplace, using the game token, is a perfect way to create a use for the token in the game. Furthermore, if a small base currency fee is attached as a listing fee, the fund will be fueled due to actual economic activity.

## Hosting
But one use really isn't enough. The game itself should have plenty of uses for its own token, otherwise there's really no point in issuing them at all. The game in such a case is just an ICO with zero purpose, other than to give the founder some profit. The goal is to drive traffic to the game. And if there's traffic, again we can take advantage of it. The game can be made much more social through the inclusion of a profile page, and even more robust social networking features.

But it's important that people learn that nothing is free. Web 1.0 and 2.0 were all about providing services that the user didn't pay for at all. This "everything for free" mentality is what created a group of large businesses, like Facebook et al. that relied solely on Advertisements for revenue, and which were therefore beholden to advertisers above all else. Unfortunately, [if you want businesses to treat you well, you have to pay them](https://medium.com/politicoid/if-you-want-businesses-to-treat-you-well-pay-them-7aeb3d1cc2b0?source=friends_link&sk=4135756d55af1430b07f6b928c5fa99e).

# Welcome to TWorldBuilder
With all of this information avaialble, it's now easy to see how to create an entertaining game that uses the existing "economic games" as a foundation and yet produces something of real value to real people. TWorldBuilder is a project that will utilize real world economic theory, some theory on blockchain, and gaming, to create an ongoing game that should survive for a very long time. Moreover, it will act as the foundation for a social network that's unlike any other.
