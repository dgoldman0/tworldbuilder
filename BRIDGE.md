# Inter-Game Bridges

Because a lot of the assets in games are on the blockchain and are semi-independent of the game in which they were created, third party support is possible. Bridges will be systems which allow the exchange of resources into and out of World Builder. In order to allow many bridges, the game itself will have hooks and interfaces to create bridges. The goal is to allow third party developers to create their own bridges and manage what resources are added to the bridge.

# Resource Creator

If the goal is to allow anyone to create a bridge, there will need to be a resource creator contract. It will essentially be a market where the user can configure exactly what product they want and the price is worked out accordingly. Investigators will be one such resource. The cost of the investigator will depend on the exact traits requested. Investigators therefore won't be bred. They will be created using these bridges.

## Collectible Status

If investigators are to be collectibles, then there needs to be a certain element of randomness. One option is to pay for higher probability of stats, rather than paying for specific stats, or giving randomness in other ways, such as appearance.

The creation process for this game is fairly unique, because instead of breeding or generating purely random collectibles for purchase, this system is more of an exchange of resources.

# Approval

While the goal is to allow as much third party support as possible, security is of course an issue. Therefore the addition of a new bridge will have to go through an approval process, likely involving staking a certain amount of resources to show good faith.
